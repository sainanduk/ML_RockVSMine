# Sonar ML Project - Rock vs. Mine Classification

Welcome to the Sonar ML Project - Rock vs. Mine Classification repository! This project focuses on utilizing machine learning to predict whether an underwater object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine. Sonar technology plays a crucial role in various applications, including underwater navigation and defense systems. This project aims to contribute to the field by employing machine learning techniques to enhance object classification.

## Dataset

The project uses the [Sonar Mines vs. Rocks dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayurdalvi/sonar-mine-dataset)
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sainanduk/ML_RockVSMine.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ML_RockVSMine
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Jupyter Notebook

Explore and run the machine learning model in the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/sonar_ml_project.ipynb
```

Follow the step-by-step instructions and execute the cells to train the model and make predictions.

### Python Script

To use the machine learning model in a Python script, follow these steps:

1. Open the `src/predict.py` script:

   ```bash
   nano src/predict.py
   ```

2. Modify the script to input your sonar data and obtain predictions.

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python src/predict.py
   ```

## Model Evaluation

The project includes model evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the machine learning model. These metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
